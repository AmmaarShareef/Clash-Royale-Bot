# Clash-Royale-Bot

Not really a full fledged bot, a simple helper that displays opponent elixir and possible cards in hand, which is not displayed usually.

Constraints:

- Only train 8 classes as of now.
- User's deck can't contain any duplicates from opponents to avoid any disruption.
- Distinct and specific cards
